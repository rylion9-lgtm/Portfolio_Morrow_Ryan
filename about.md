## Background

Hi, I’m Ryan Morrow, a Statistics student at Brigham Young University with an emphasis in Data Science and Analytics. I’m passionate about using data to understand patterns, solve real-world problems, and support better decision-making.

My academic background has focused on statistical modeling, programming, and data visualization. Through coursework and projects, I’ve worked with real datasets to perform analysis, build dashboards, and communicate insights clearly.

I’m especially interested in careers that combine technical analytics with business strategy — such as data analytics, business intelligence, or data science roles — where I can help organizations make data-driven decisions.
